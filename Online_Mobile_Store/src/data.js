      "The Vivo V23 Pro is a slim and light smartphone with a tricked-out back panel, which should appeal to the fashionistas. It offers a capable set of cameras too but falls a bit short when it comes to the basics.It’s colour-changing design is unique and the build quality feels premium with a polycarbonate frame sandwiched between two sheets of glass with curved sides. However, it lacks stereo speakers and has a medium-sized notch on the display, which looks a bit dated.",

      "The iPhone 12 costs more than its predecessors but has a crisp new HDR OLED screen. It offers nearly all the feaures of the iPhone 12 Pro, minus some camera capabilities, but should be a good enough package for most users. Apple has returned to a flat aluminium frame but the iPhone 12 promises to be more durable thanks to its Ceramic Shield material on the front and IP68 rating. ",

    info:
      "The iPhone 13 Pro Max is Apple's biggest iPhone, but it doens't have any advantages over the iPhone 13 Pro in terms of features, unlike in previous generations. It's heavy and unwieldy, but the big display is great for games and the increased battery capacity allows for nearly two full days of regular use. The display gets a 120Hz refresh rate, but there's still an unsightly notch that interferes with movies. Performance is great thanks to the A15 Bionic SoC. You can choose betweeen 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options. The main new features are camera-related: Cinematic Mode and Photographic Styles. The camera hardware has also been improved, compared to the previous generation. You can now take macros and the optical zoom goes up to 3X. Although incredibly expensive, the iPhone 13 Pro Max represents the best of the best in the iPhone lineup.",

    info:
      "The Redmi Note 10 isn't pathbreaking in terms of features and specifications for the sub-Rs. 12,000 segment, but it does cover all the bases and offer a few nice extra touches. It's slimmer and lighter than the Redmi Note 9, and debuts a new 'Evol' design language which makes it look quite smart. The 6.43-inch full-HD+ AMOLED screen is a major highlight, producing crisp details and colours that pop. You get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 SoC which is powerful enough for casual gaming as well as everyday tasks. Battery life is good enough to get you through at least a full day, and charging is quick. The cameras are quite ordinary, with the 48-megapixel primary one taking good shots in the daytime ad acceptable ones at night. The ultra-wide and selfie cameras are also serviceable, but the macro one is just for amusement. MIUI is still full of promotional content and ads, but the company promises to remove these with a future update.",
